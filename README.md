# Introduction to Python

## <b>What is Python?</b>
If you search on Internet, it will show you that Python is, at this moment, one of the most popular programming language to develop web sites and software, and it's also used to data analyst. 

The most famous programs developed by Python are:
1. Pinterest
2. Panda 3D
3. Dropbox
4. Spotify
5. Netflix
6. Uber
7. Instagram
8. Reddit
9. Google
10. Youtube

As you can see, most of apps that we use so often are developed by Python. That's the reason why I want to learn to program in python and I want to share with you every thing that I learn to improve my writing skills and Technical language.




## FIRST STEP: DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION

- To use Python, we have to download it. We can do it just by clicking in "Download" button in this page (just make sure that you're downloading the right version for you Operating System): 
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

- After the download, we have to install it, so we have to open de "file" and follow the steps and remember to add it to the "path".
- To make sure that the installation was successfull, you can open de shell of your OS and write "python", and it will appear like this :

## SECOND STEP: HELLO WORLD


- If we continue in the shell, after writing "python", you can use it... So, to print our first "Hello World" in Python we just have to write "print("Hello World")" and click enter. It will appear like this:

And that's it... Our first Hello World!! <3 Congrats!! We are doing an amazing job! 



## THIRD STEP: OPEN A PY FILE

- What if we want to do the "Hello World" more "pro"... To do that, we can open the IDLE of Python:

- After that, a new file will be shown, there we are going to write "print("Hello World")" and save the file as a Python file.

> [!NOTE]
> We can also use the NOTEPAD to create the new file, just make sure to save it as a Python file (.py).

- We have the file now, so, how can we open it? Easy... Just open de shell and go to the direction where you saved the file, and write "python HelloWorld.py" or "python" and the name of your file .py, and click enter; it has to show "Hello world" in the console.
